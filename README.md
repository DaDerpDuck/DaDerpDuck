US Marine who programs for fun. From Roblox games to Minecraft mods, I love coding entertaining stuff! I primarily do game design, but I have experience in web development (front- and back-end) too. I'm most confident in Lua, Java, and JavaScript, though I can kinda do Python and C#.

I've also built a computer on a binary simulator too, a calculator in Minecraft, competed in CyberPatriot, participated in my high school's robotics team as a programmer, and one of my mods amassed over 1 million downloads. Gotta love computer engineering :p
